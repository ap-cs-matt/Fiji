	<h2><font color="1A237E" face="Arial"<b>Rugby</b></font></h2>
	<p><h4>Rugby is Fijis most popular and prestigious sport. Along with Rugby World Cup victories, They now have something of more value to add to their Rugby trophy case. 
	The 2016 Olympics brought Fiji their first ever Olympic metal. Their first metal was gold in a sport that is praised in Fiji with passion and intensity, Rugby. 
	The men's Rugby team brought back Gold for demolishing Great Britain in the finals 43-7. Fiji being a small country of roughly 900,000 people does not have many major sports in it's country. 
	With this being the case, the people of Fiji put all of their faith in Rugby as it quickly proved to be their number one sport. With little to no hope in getting a metal in any other sport, Rugby was all they had.
	This long awaited metal was welcomed in Fiji with open arms.</h4>

	<h2><font color="1A237E" face="Arial"<b>Boat Racing</b></font></h2>
	<p><h4>Aside from Rugby, Boat Racing is the most prominent sport in Fijian culture. Though it is not organized and necessarily competitive, Boat Racing is a major part Fiji's history and culture. 
	Fiji, being an island certainly has enough water to host many races through out the year.Along with minor races and recreational races, each year, Fiji partakes in the annual Veitau Waqa race. 
	This event features a select number of sailors racing in historical Fijian canoes called Camakau canoes. 
	These canoes were used for sailing and fishing in Fiji in the history of fishing and are very old which makes the races interesting but yes, very slow. 
	This race is a yearly tradition that remembers Fiji's history. </h4>
