         Rugby is Fijis most popular and prestigious sport. Along with Rugby World Cup victories, They now have something of more value to add to their Rugby trophy case. 
	The 2016 Olympics brought Fiji their first ever Olympic metal. Their first metal was gold in a sport that is praised in Fiji with passion and intensity, Rugby. 
	The men's Rugby team brought back Gold for demolishing Great Britain in the finals 43-7. Fiji being a small country of roughly 900,000 people does not have many major sports in it's country. 
	With this being the case, the people of Fiji put all of their faith in Rugby as it quickly proved to be their number one sport. With little to no hope in getting a metal in any other sport, Rugby was all they had.
	This long awaited metal was welcomed in Fiji with open arms.
